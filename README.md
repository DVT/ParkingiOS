[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/6fda7ea6e9db9749/status.svg?token=1BrGcwxTloXX42YOuaS9cQ)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/6fda7ea6e9db9749)

### Park it - Parking Assistant
“Park it” is a parking assistant which will find the user a parking spot in parking structures whether it be at a mall or a block of flats, it will make use of data gathered by ultrasonic sensors which will determine whether a parking is currently occupied or not this data will be stored in a Firebase real-time database with an iOS application acting as the front end. When the user opens the application it will bring up the data of the closest parking structure and will guide the user to the nearest parking spot.
Core goals: 
Provide the user with an application that will show them the current state of the parkings around them in a graphical representation, “Park it” will then navigate the user to the closest parking. The application will also display information that the user may find useful such as the rates for parking as well as what shops the parking spot is close to. The user will be able to specify what type of parking space they are looking for e.g. normal, family or disability.
### Eventual goals:
Some of the features that we would like to implement if time allows would be: 
- A payment method where the user can pay for the parking, after payment the app will generate a QR code that will allow the user to exit the parking.
- A reservation system, which would allow the user to reserve a certain parking for an extra fee.
- A graphical representation of the data such as what percentage of parking is taken/available (Pie chart) 
- A number plate reading system, where the system would be able to link the user to the car, this would allow multiple other features, such as notifying if there car is moving while they are not with their car, as well as adding violations to the user’s profile, if they were to park in a reserved parking etc.
